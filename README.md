# Beyond the block based API: a simple Future

This repository contains the code that I used during my live coding talk at Swift Summit 2015 in San Francisco. 
With this talk, I have attempted to show how [Futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) can be used to simplify asynchronous programming.

[View all code changes made during the talk.](https://github.com/Thomvis/SFSwiftSummit2015/compare/9f38ae6fa65b31540f2b1ebd110965c51bb38690...02e0cdcb52e8f780e8c8590092f82e840d896805)

If you want to use futures in your code, I can recommend [BrightFutures](https://github.com/Thomvis/BrightFutures).
